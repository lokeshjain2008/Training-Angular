// Getting started with the JavaScript
// What is JavaScript

// JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted,
// or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

// What is ECMAScript
//  ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications.
// The following ECMAScript standards have been approved or are being worked on:

// The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
// DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

(function() {
  // alert("Hello this is JavaScript");
})();
